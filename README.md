# Clicky-Game

** First `React` application

* This game is played by clicking on different images, avoiding the last image clicked. Every `onClick` should shuffle the images into different positions. Each time you click a different image, the `count` increments until you click the same image again, which is saved as a `highScore`.
    - The `highScore` constant checks to see if the `count` '>' `highScore`

* The app only renders three `components` and uses 2 arrow functions (count, shuffle).
